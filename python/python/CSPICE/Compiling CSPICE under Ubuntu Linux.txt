Subject: Compiling CSPICE under Ubuntu Linux
Reply-To: rfrench@rfrench.org

To link cspice with Python, it must be compiled with the option
"-fno-stack-protector" to avoid linker errors. Â The cspice build
environment allows this by saying:

TKCOMPILEOPTIONS = "-c -ansi -DNON_UNIX_STDIO -fno-stack-protector"
export TKCOMPILEOPTIONS
./makeall.csh

In addition, the Python cspice link line needs to be changed from the Mac
version:

Delete -bundle
Delete -flat_namespace
Delete -undefined suppress
Add -shared
Add the library libpython2.6.a (or equivalent) with -lpython2.6
